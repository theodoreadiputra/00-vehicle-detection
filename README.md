Vehicle detection is a computer vision technology that can automatically identify the presence of vehicles in images or videos. It is a critical component of many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications, such as traffic monitoring, congestion detection, and autonomous vehicles.

Vehicle detection is a computer vision technology that can automatically identify the presence of vehicles in images or videos. It is a critical component of many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications, such as traffic monitoring, congestion detection, and autonomous vehicles.

Vehicle detection has a wide range of applications, including:

Traffic monitoring: Vehicle detection can be used to monitor traffic flow, identify congestion, and track the movement of vehicles. This information can be used to improve traffic management and reduce congestion.
Autonomous vehicles: Vehicle detection is essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely. Autonomous vehicles need to be able to detect other vehicles on the road, as well as pedestrians, cyclists, and other obstacles.
Security: Vehicle detection can be used to monitor parking lots, secure facilities, and other areas where unauthorized vehicles are not allowed.
